News Article Generation with LSTM Neural Network
Overview
This project is a word-level text generation model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) nodes in a neural network to generate realistic news articles. The model was trained on news articles from the BBC, learning patterns in the language to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.

Objective
The purpose of this project is to explore sequence-based text generation using neural networks, with a focus on creating content in a formal and journalistic style similar to BBC news articles.
